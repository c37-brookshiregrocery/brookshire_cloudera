## ATTENDEES
- Michael Brendan (CEO & Co-founder, Codename37; Strategic Partner of Cloudera)
- Dr. Jake Tripple (CTO & Co-founder, Codename37; College Professor at Concordia University, St. Paul)
- Richard (also referred to as Rich) (Network team member; Texas A&M Computer Science graduate; organization not specified)
- Jordan (participant; no role/company specified)
- Mike (participant mentioned as part of the presenting team; likely same person as Michael Brendan, but referenced separately in the transcript)
- Jake (participant referenced early in informal discussion; likely Dr. Jake Tripple, but name is also used generically in side conversation)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The meeting began with informal conversation and then transitioned into a scheduled vendor/partner introduction intended to brief Richard (a network-focused IT leader) on Cloudera’s unified data platform and explore potential fit for Richard’s organization. The call experienced technical issues with Microsoft Teams (Richard reported “no one’s on the Teams call” / “waiting for a person to join”), and the group switched to Zoom to proceed. Michael Brendan (Codename37 CEO) and Dr. Jake Tripple (Codename37 CTO) introduced their backgrounds and positioned Codename37 as a Cloudera strategic partner with expertise spanning data platforms, AI infrastructure, and AI solutions.

The core discussion centered on hybrid IT realities (on-prem plus cloud), cost control challenges in public cloud (particularly for storage and AI workloads), and the need for unified data platforms to reduce data silos and integration complexity. Richard shared that his organization is moving development focus toward Azure, operates multiple data centers ("like four data centers" plus Azure), is trying to consolidate, and is actively concerned about cloud cost escalation. Snowflake was mentioned as an emerging initiative inside Richard’s organization, though Richard noted he is “kind of outside that realm” due to being on the network team.

Codename37 advocated for Cloudera as a preferred option because it can run both on-prem and in-cloud, “goes to where your data is,” and can reduce ingress/egress charges and governance concerns versus cloud-only platforms. Governance, data residency/ownership, and security were emphasized, including the point that Cloudera is “approved by the DOD” and offers strong end-to-end control. The tone was collegial and exploratory—more educational than transactional—with Richard indicating the overview was “very enlightening” and that he would discuss it with colleagues more directly involved in data platform decisions, while keeping Codename37 in mind as a resource for network and architecture discussions supporting AI growth.

## KEY DECISIONS
1. Switch the meeting platform from Microsoft Teams to Zoom.
   - Decision maker/approver: The meeting host (unnamed in transcript) coordinated with Richard; Richard agreed.
   - Context/rationale: Teams link behavior was inconsistent—Richard saw “waiting for a person to join,” while others could join; “Teams has been weird…this week.”
   - Impact: Enabled the group to proceed with the Cloudera/Codename37 overview without further delay.

2. Preferred name usage: Richard will be addressed as “Richard” (not “Rich”).
   - Decision maker/approver: Richard.
   - Context/rationale: Michael asked “Rich or Richard, which do you prefer?” and Richard replied “Mostly go by Richard.”
   - Impact: Sets communication preference for future interactions.

3. Meeting format decision: Use a whiteboard-style walkthrough instead of PowerPoint.
   - Decision maker/approver: Codename37 team proposed; Richard implicitly accepted.
   - Context/rationale: “Jake’s on what we call a light board…we don’t do PowerPoint presentations…we prefer to whiteboard things out.”
   - Impact: Defines how future technical briefings/demos will be delivered.

4. Directional technology stance discussed (not a finalized procurement decision): Richard’s organization is focusing development primarily on Azure while remaining hybrid.
   - Decision maker/approver: Richard described this as an ongoing organizational direction.
   - Context/rationale: Transition pathway to Azure while maintaining some on-prem applications; strong emphasis on cost controls; exploration of colo to manage cost.
   - Impact: Suggests any data/AI platform strategy (including Cloudera) must support hybrid deployments and cost governance.

## ACTION ITEMS
- Task: Create and send a Zoom meeting link to Richard and reconvene on Zoom (due to Teams issues) | Owner: Meeting host (name not explicitly stated) | Due: Immediate (during the meeting)
- Task: Discuss Cloudera/unified data platform overview internally with colleagues “more in depth in the middle of this” (e.g., those evaluating Snowflake and data platform strategy) | Owner: Richard | Due: Not specified
- Task: Keep Codename37 on the stakeholder list for future discussions about network architecture and scaling to support AI/hybrid connectivity | Owner: Richard | Due: Not specified

## NEXT STEPS
Immediate actions (within 1 week)
- Reconvene/continue the conversation on Zoom (this occurred as an immediate remediation step after Teams failed).

Short-term actions (1-4 weeks)
- Richard to socialize the Cloudera positioning (hybrid/on-prem + cloud, governance, cost/egress considerations) with internal teams leading the unified data platform and Snowflake-related discussions.
- Potential scheduling of a follow-up working session where Codename37 can “throw our hat in the ring” and provide recommendations on network/architecture needed to support AI-scale data movement and hybrid routing (no date set).

Long-term initiatives (beyond 1 month)
- Ongoing hybrid-to-Azure transition planning, including consolidation of data centers and evaluation of colo options to manage costs.
- Continued evaluation/selection of unified data platform components (Snowflake and/or alternatives) with attention to data ownership, data residency, governance, and avoiding future “AI silos.”

Follow-up meetings or check-ins planned
- No specific follow-up meeting was scheduled in the transcript; intent was expressed to keep Codename37 engaged for future architecture discussions.

## TOPICS DISCUSSED
- **Scheduling/tools and meeting logistics**: Brief discussion on calendar tools (standardizing on Outlook, sometimes using client-preferred tools like Google). Later, troubleshooting a failed Microsoft Teams join and switching the meeting to Zoom.
- **Sports and personal small talk (extended)**: NHL (Minnesota Wild loss to Devils; Lightning 10-game win streak), NFL/playoffs and Vikings frustrations, Minnesota college sports performance; speculative discussion about Eagles’ struggles.
- **Introductions and company positioning**: Codename37 introductions (Michael Brendan—CEO/co-founder; Dr. Jake Tripple—CTO/co-founder) and their role as a strategic partner of Cloudera; emphasis on architecture/data platforms/AI solutions.
- **Customer environment discovery (high level)**: Richard describes being on the network team; organization is hybrid with ~4 data centers plus Azure; consolidation efforts; development focus “mainly on Azure.”
- **Unified Data Platform concept and vendors**: Discussion of unified data platforms and references to Snowflake, Databricks, Informatica; question raised whether the organization is pursuing these (Richard notes Snowflake is “coming up” but he’s outside that realm).
- **Cloudera overview and differentiators**: Positioning Cloudera as unique for on-prem + cloud deployment, “goes to where your data is,” helps avoid ingress/egress costs, and supports governance/security requirements.
- **Cloud cost management and workload placement**: Ongoing theme about cloud cost spikes, watching routing/pathways for cheapest and most effective connectivity, considering colo, and keeping some workloads on-prem.
- **Future-looking technology discussion (extended)**: AI growth driving bandwidth/compute needs; risks of “AI silos”; quantum computing timelines; IPv6 paradigm; energy constraints and nuclear fusion/small modular reactors; robotics and automation potential (e.g., household humanoid robots).

## TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS
- **Calendar/communications stack**: Standardization on **Outlook** for calendars, with occasional use of client tools (e.g., Google).
- **Collaboration platform failure and workaround**: **Microsoft Teams** join/link behavior was inconsistent (Richard saw “waiting for a person to join” while others could join). Decision: **move to Zoom** immediately (ad-hoc Zoom link created) to continue the meeting.
- **Hybrid infrastructure landscape**: Richard reports **~4 data centers** (excluding Azure), plus an **Azure presence**, with efforts to **consolidate** data centers and build a “pathway to Azure.”
- **Cloud networking/routing concerns**: Richard highlights designing **routing/pathways** to cloud providers (Azure and potentially Google Cloud mentioned) with goals of:
  - minimizing cost (implied: transit/egress/peering choices)
  - maintaining effective performance
  - supporting applications split across on-prem and multiple clouds.
- **Cloud cost/architecture constraints**:
  - Cloud spend can “skyrocket” without cost controls.
  - AI workloads in public cloud described as potentially “unbearable/unaffordable,” motivating **on-prem or colo** options.
- **Unified Data Platform (UDP) technical rationale**:
  - Problem statement: enterprise data silos and brittle integrations (ETL/ELT, “nine different hops,” schema/field changes breaking downstream reports).
  - Risk called out: emerging **“AI silos”** if every vendor/tool builds separate AI stacks.
- **Cloudera architectural differentiators (as presented)**:
  - Runs **on-prem and in cloud** (hybrid-friendly) vs vendors that require data centralization in their cloud service.
  - “Goes to where your data is,” reducing **data movement** and potential **ingress/egress** charges.
  - Positioning for strong **governance/security**, including mention of **DoD approval** and “control of your whole stack from A to Z.”
  - Noted coexistence pattern: **Cloudera + Snowflake** (Snowflake leveraging Cloudera’s on-prem capability).
- **Network scale trajectory driven by AI**: Discussion that AI/agents will sharply increase east-west and north-south traffic demands; implies need to rethink bandwidth and infrastructure sizing.
- **IPv6 technical paradigm**: Richard notes IPv6 as “one interface, 100,000 IPs” and references multicast/anycast concepts as a shift from IPv4’s common “one interface, one IP” mental model.
- **Quantum computing implications (speculative)**: Potential obsolescence of current chips/programming paradigms; impacts on cryptography (“all mathematical security…irrelevant” once sufficiently powerful quantum exists).
- **Energy/power infrastructure considerations for compute**: Discussion that AI/compute growth pressures the grid; mentions **fusion breakthroughs** and **small modular nuclear reactors** as potential enabling infrastructure for next-gen compute demands.

## BUSINESS UPDATES
- **Go-to-market/positioning for Codename37**:
  - Codename37 described as a **strategic partner of Cloudera** and takes “first calls for Cloudera” due to architecture/data platform/AI expertise.
  - Claims of having an alliance ecosystem with **“access to over 12,000 engineers globally.”**
- **Customer strategic direction (high level)**:
  - Richard’s organization is **transitioning toward Azure** (development focus mainly on Azure) while remaining **hybrid** (some apps stay on-prem).
  - The organization is evaluating **consolidation** (data centers) and potentially a **colo** to manage costs.
- **Cloud cost governance as a business driver**:
  - Cloud costs described as rising quickly if not controlled; discussion suggests cost pressures are influencing architecture choices (keeping/bringing workloads on-prem, colo).
  - Example cited (anecdotal): Thompson Reuters moving ~**98% to cloud** and then facing board scrutiny over costs (illustrative, not necessarily this customer’s metric).
- **Vendor landscape/competition**:
  - Snowflake/Databricks/Informatica referenced as common UDP options; Cloudera positioned as differentiated by hybrid/on-prem capability and governance.
- **No direct revenue/KPI updates**: No explicit sales figures, pipeline stages, contract values, or deadlines were provided; the meeting appears to be an early-stage discovery/intro call.

## PEOPLE UPDATES
- **Attendee identities and roles clarified**:
  - **Michael Brendan** introduced as CEO/co-founder of Codename37.
  - **Dr. Jake Tripple** introduced as CTO/co-founder; also a professor at **Concordia University, St. Paul**.
  - **Richard** (prefers “Richard”) is the customer participant; identifies himself as being on the **network team** and “outside” the Snowflake/data platform domain.
- **No staffing or HR changes**: No mentions of hiring, departures, promotions, reorganizations, or staffing gaps.
- **Implied stakeholder handoff**: Richard indicates he will discuss with “the other guys who are more in depth in the middle of this” (suggesting additional internal stakeholders for data/server/platform roadmap), but no names or ownership were specified.

## INSIGHTS & TAKEAWAYS
- **Hybrid is persistent; architecture must support mixed workloads**: Richard’s environment (multiple data centers + Azure) and the broader discussion reinforce that many enterprises will remain hybrid for cost, performance, or governance reasons.
- **Cloud cost controls are a primary constraint, not an afterthought**: The group repeatedly notes cloud cost escalation—especially for data movement (egress) and AI workloads—driving interest in colo/on-prem strategies and careful routing decisions.
- **Unified Data Platforms address integration brittleness and silo sprawl**: The meeting highlights historical pain of many-hop ETL/ELT pipelines and siloed systems breaking dashboards when upstream changes occur; UDPs are framed as a mitigation.
- **Emerging risk: “AI silos”**: Beyond data silos, the team flags the risk that multiple disconnected AI stacks/tools will recreate fragmentation; consolidating data and governance first is positioned as foundational.
- **Cloudera’s proposed differentiators (per presenters)**: Key claimed value is being able to deploy where the data lives (on-prem/cloud/both), reducing data movement and improving governance; also presented as compatible alongside Snowflake.
- **Network and infrastructure planning must anticipate steep growth curves**: AI/agent proliferation is expected to drive near-vertical increases in bandwidth and compute needs; Richard’s focus on delivering “A to Z bandwidth” aligns with this.
- **Security/governance concerns remain central**: Richard’s question “who owns the data” and where it resides (jurisdiction/regulatory) underscores that governance and control are critical selection criteria for cloud/data platforms.
- **Next-step implication (not formally assigned)**: Richard plans to talk with internal platform/data stakeholders; Codename37 offered to provide guidance on network/infrastructure scaling and keep themselves on his shortlist. (No explicit owner/date commitments were made.)

## RISKS & CONCERNS
- **Meeting access/communications tooling instability (Teams join failure)**
  - **Description:** Richard could not join the Microsoft Teams call (“no one’s on the Teams call… waiting for a person to join”), despite the host being able to join from phone and computer; they had to switch to Zoom.
  - **Severity/impact:** Medium—caused ~15+ minutes delay and disrupted meeting start; risks future stakeholder frustration and missed time windows.
  - **Likelihood:** Medium—team notes “Teams has been weird… this week.”

  - **Owner:** Meeting host/organizer (unnamed in transcript) to standardize meeting platform and provide backup links.

- **Cloud cost overruns and lack of cost governance (especially AI workloads)**
  - **Description:** Richard and the team noted cloud costs “skyrocket fast if you don’t watch it,” and that “running AI workloads in the cloud is almost unbearable/unaffordable.” Mention of exploring colo to control cost.
  - **Severity/impact:** High—uncontrolled spend can force architectural reversals, board scrutiny, and constrain AI initiatives.
  - **Likelihood:** High—stated as an active concern during their Azure migration/hybrid state.
  - **Mitigation proposed:**
    - Consider colocation and/or on-prem placement for heavy workloads.
    - Use hybrid architectures to place compute near data and avoid unnecessary data movement.
    - Avoid architectures that require frequent data egress.
  - **Owner:** Richard’s org (network/infrastructure) plus cloud/platform owners (unnamed) who manage Azure and data platforms.

- **Data ownership, residency, and regulatory uncertainty with public cloud providers**
  - **Description:** Richard explicitly raised concerns: “When that data gets out… who owns it?”, “Where is it sitting?”, and “whose regulatory/country environment is it sitting in?”
  - **Severity/impact:** High—can create compliance, legal, and security exposure.
  - **Likelihood:** Medium to High—especially relevant as they route/stand up workloads in Azure and possibly other clouds.
  - **Mitigation proposed:**
    - Maintain stronger governance and control of the stack.

  - **Owner:** Enterprise architecture / data & AI leadership (not present).

- **Network architecture capacity risk as AI traffic grows exponentially**
  - **Description:** Richard stated the network team is evaluating “what architecture do we need to switch into to support this,” anticipating near-vertical growth; AI “pushing” 400G and toward terabit needs.
  - **Severity/impact:** High—insufficient bandwidth/architecture could block AI initiatives and cloud/hybrid connectivity.
  - **Likelihood:** High—explicitly an active evaluation now.
  - **Mitigation proposed:** Engage experts to review/advise; redesign network pathways for cheapest/most effective routing to clouds (Azure, possible Google Cloud).
  - **Owner:** Richard (network team lead/participant) plus infrastructure/network engineering teams.

- **Cybersecurity risk escalation in the AI era**
  - **Description:** Jake warned cybersecurity will “come back to the front” as “really smart people start doing really stupid things,” especially in Richard’s domain.
  - **Severity/impact:** High—potential for breaches, misuse of AI, governance failures.
  - **Likelihood:** Medium—framed as increasing/inevitable trend.
  - **Mitigation proposed:** Strong governance and control of ingestion/orchestration/storage; platform-level security controls; consideration of DOD-approved architectures for high assurance.
  - **Owner:** Security/CISO org; platform governance owners.

- **Dependency risk: limited visibility into server/platform roadmap for planning network and hybrid architecture**
  - **Description:** Richard said he “doesn’t know the road map… to our server platforms and where you’re going with those,” which impedes informed network planning.
  - **Severity/impact:** Medium—can lead to misaligned capacity planning and suboptimal routing/colo decisions.
  - **Likelihood:** High—current state today.
  - **Mitigation proposed:** Coordinate with server/platform teams; obtain roadmap; align network architecture accordingly.
  - **Owner:** Richard to coordinate internally with server/platform leadership; platform owners to provide roadmap.

- **Strategic/technology transition uncertainty (IPv6 paradigm shifts, quantum impact on security, power constraints)**
  - **Description:** Discussion touched on IPv6 complexity, quantum potentially invalidating “all mathematical security,” and power grid inadequacy requiring nuclear/fusion.
  - **Severity/impact:** Long-term High (if realized); near-term Low to Medium (mostly exploratory).
  - **Likelihood:** Unclear—speculative timelines (5–7 years suggested for quantum maturity; fusion possibly 2027 claim).
  - **Mitigation proposed:** None concrete beyond awareness and planning mindset.
  - **Owner:** Not assigned; would fall to enterprise strategy, security, and infrastructure planning functions.

## 📄 TRANSCRIPT

Hopefully this was still open when I confirmed him yesterday and I sent him the text this morning, so it should be good. What do you guys use for, you guys use Outlook for calendars? Yeah, we have Outlook. There's a couple different ones. We'll use what a client wants sometimes, so there's a couple like Googles out there and stuff, but we standardize on Outlook. Okay. Good. Good, good. Well, I went to the Wild game last night, boys, and it was a shit show. Five to two, they got beat by the Devils. It was wild, huh? Oh, geez. Yeah, it was wild, all right. Yeah, I was watching the Lightning game and I was wondering how they were doing, and I checked over, and yeah, it's not good to see. I mean, they're tearing it up this year, but of course the game I go to, they lost. And my daughter was there with some friends. I texted her, but I accidentally texted Jake, so Jake's like, what? What are you saying? Sorry about that, Jake. I figured it was something like that, but anyway. Well, I'm looking up. We had pretty good seats. I'm looking up in the club level where my daughter was, and I'm like, is what friends wearing a hat? I think I see you guys up there, and she's like, yeah, and I go, I totally see you. So I picked her out of the crowd. It was packed. It was sold out, so it was kind of funny. Eagle Eye. Jake probably thought you were sending them tickets. My friend wearing a hat? What are you talking about? How'd the Lightning do? Ten game win streak. We kept it alive yesterday, so they're doing great right now. It's unbelievable. I know. They started off so rough, too, in the start of the year. They had a big losing streak, and we're down at the bottom, and people were writing them off, saying, well, Lightning, it's over. It's been a fun ride, and sure as shit, they start rattling off some wins. Gooch is in the top five of points all of a sudden again. Here we go. Love it. We ain't done yet. That's so awesome. You guys sound like Minnesota fans. That's how we are. Oh, another losing season. Yeah, well, we're used to winning so much. That's the thing. That's the thing. That's the thing. That's the thing. People were like, well, it's been nice. It's been a long time. We've had fun. But yeah, it ain't over yet. Must be rough, huh, Jake? We're just used to losing teams. The Gophers. The Vikings. Yeah. The only thing that pisses me off is our college sports. I mean, outside of hockey, Minnesota's awesome for college hockey. I mean, we've had years where the Frozen Four was almost all Minnesota teams. Remember that? I mean, we have some great hockey here. Yeah. Outside of hockey, Minnesota College Sports is the most frustrating thing. I still cannot believe we cannot fuel the decent football team in the Big Ten. Yeah. I just don't get it, man. I don't get it. I don't understand. Maybe it's the cold weather. You know, students don't want to go there to go to school, maybe. I don't know. I feel like cold weather scares a lot of guys like that. Yeah. I mean, I think that's... I think it's part of it, but given that we're a bigger market than some of these other Big Ten teams. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's a lot to offer. I just, in terms of, like, overarching experiences, I just don't flippin' get why we can't... I'm not saying we need to compete for the national title, but we should be a top 25 with our advantage as a top 25 ranked team. But we can't even, like... We're destined to be in the... Sorry, what bowls we play. I'll just call it the toilet bowl every year. You know what I mean? As a... 72nd ranked team in the country, and it's ridiculous. We don't have the awesomeness you guys have in Florida, where you guys are competing for national titles every year across multiple teams. Yeah, we're a little spoiled. I agree down here. But, hey, let me give Rich a call. Okay, I'll be right back. I want to make sure he's not late. One minute. No worries. Yep, no worries. Thank you for listening to my epic rant on Minnesota sports. Frustrating, man. Dude, it's that... It's the rant I do all day long. So it's... It's like whenever we have just a glimpse of hope, it just gets shattered. It's like... Well, it's like... There's a coach. He goes to... I'm sorry. I don't know what you think about Indiana. I've been to Indianapolis multiple times. Nice town. Great thing. But I'm sorry. It's Indiana. There's basketball hoops and crops. That's it. And then you, like... As you're zooming down the state, you hit their version of 494. You go around Indianapolis. You keep going south to Kentucky. And that's it. There's nothing else. Why do they have a good football team? Yeah, but they have a ridiculous football team. And they're going to win. But somehow, they were able to recruit. I want to tell our guy to row his freaking boat someplace else. Jesus. Come on. He's hopping on in a second, by the way, guys. I just talked to him. It's just... No worries. Shift that passion towards the technology there, Jake. This is why unified data platforms matter. God damn it. So are you a Vikings fan then, Jake? Sounds like you're a football guy. I'm a Vikings fan, unfortunately. Live and die with them. I mean, you guys had some good years. You had a little... I thought JJ was going to do a lot better than he did. I don't know about him. That was scary. And, of course, the quarterback we let go is going to be playing in the NFC Championship. Oh, man. I know. What a great decision on our part. He did not play that good for us. What was that? Whenever we had a game that mattered, he'd... Well, it all comes down to the offensive line. You know, you put some of these guys in front of a crappy offensive line like you guys have, and that's all of a sudden what happens. You end up giving some of these dudes some time, and they show up, and it's like, whoa, why did we get rid of him? It's like... You know, you're absolutely right, Jordan. It's... He would spend four seconds in the pocket, but he only had two and a half because our line was so weak last year. Good point. He needed four seconds to release the ball, and he didn't have it. Christ, did you guys... That Houston... I didn't watch the game last night. I just saw some of the highlights, but that Houston defense is legit, man. Holy Christ. They've come on, too. You know, a lot of these guys will fall off a little towards the end of the year, and that deed's only gotten stronger. Yeah, it was a hell of an effort last night. I mean... Two defensive scores. That Seahawk defense is legit. That Houston defense is legit. You got some rock star defenses here in the playoffs, man. Holy Christ. I know. It's going to be fun. I'm just glad there's some different teams this year, you know, a couple different guys to root for, different up-and-coming teams. It's not just the... I agree. ...in the Eagles again, you know? A thousand times. Yeah. I was so happy to see the Eagles get destroyed. It just felt good. Right. It felt good. I'm going controversy on that one, right? Nobody really knows what's going on. You know, they've had these struggles kind of all year long. I'm going with, you know, it's one of those... I'm going like soap opera, right? Somebody's, like, dating somebody's sister's daughter's cousin's roommate and it just caused dissension in the locker room kind of thing. Like, you know, something's, like, really off. You know what I mean? Well, it's the coach, you know? It seems like everybody hates the coach, the players, the fan base, all that. Yeah. But yet he's kind of winning. So it's like, well, what do you do with them? Yeah. I don't know. Like, so I'm going controversy. I'm going days of our lives kind of stuff here, right? Somebody's, like, everybody's vying over the same girlfriend and buying that girlfriend Porsches and stuff. I'm telling you, man, it's something like that. Right? But didn't... Weren't they going after each other on the sideline of that game? I don't know. Sorry, guys. I just tried to join from my team. But what is it? Rich just messaged me and said no one's on the team's call. And I literally have the... I just pressed the link above it and it worked. Weird. Hold on a second. Teams has been weird, man, this week. It's been awful. Yeah. What do you... Let me give him a call here. I'm going to figure something out. I'm going to just keep it on mute so you can kind of hear me. And I'll see if we can figure something out. Hey, Rich. That's weird. That's weird. Did you click... You clicked the link right above on the text there? Yeah, I clicked the link you sent me. That's so weird. I just clicked it to double check to make sure. And it let me in twice through my phone and through my computer. So I was in there twice. So that is really weird why it's doing that. Okay. It just says waiting for a person to join. Yeah, that's extremely odd. Okay. If I shift you over a... If I give you a Zoom, will that be okay if I pass you across a Zoom link to join? Yeah. Let's do that. I'll just put a quick Zoom together and shoot that to you. And we'll reconvene over there. I'm not sure what's going on with Teams. Okay. Awesome. Awesome. I'll do it right now. All right. Bye. All right. You guys heard that. Let me put a Zoom together, pass it across, and we'll reconvene there in a couple minutes. Okay? Sounds good. Awesome. Thanks, buddy. All right, guys. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Yeah, that's a dig. Give a second here. We should be good, hopefully, now. Can you guys hear snoring on the phone? Because my elderly dog here is snoring up a storm. No. No. No. No. Can't hear a word. It's not me. It's not me. I promise. What kind of dog? Cockapoo. She's going to be 14. And she's got, like, a little bed in my office and one over there. So she comes in here, and then she sleeps and snores. Yeah. I got an 18-year-old Chihuahua Dachshund myself. So he is... Wow. Yeah. He's in great shape, thankfully. I really do think I can get him, you know, 20-plus. I've had him forever. But, yeah, he's a great dog. That's amazing. Yeah, he's so old. Hey, Rich. Howdy. Glad we figured it out. Not sure what the heck happened there. Sorry about that. But I appreciate you finding time. Yeah, Zoom works. I know. I should have just defaulted to Zoom, but I thought it would be easier with Teams since we were texting. So that's on me. You're okay if we go a little bit further? Because I know we're 15 minutes past. You don't have a hard stop, do you? No, I can go past. Go a little bit further? Okay, cool. Cool. Yeah, I know Mike and Jake, they get into the weeds with their presentation and you don't want to throw them off track too much. Okay. In the weeds. Good stuff. So these are the guys I wanted to introduce you to, Rich. They're going to keep it really easy. We just wanted to talk about Cloudera a little bit, show you some of the features, and just see if we can help you out with anything as we go through the year here. So I'll let them kind of get into it, introduce themselves, and we'll go from there, but appreciate you finding the time. Okay. Yeah, no problem. So Rich or Richard, which do you prefer? Mostly go by Richard. Okay. Well, Richard, absolute pleasure to meet you. My name is Michael Brendan. I'm CEO and co-founder of Codename37. We're a strategic partner of Cloudera. So we typically take these first calls for Cloudera as we have deep expertise in architecture, data platforms, and AI solutions. So we kind of round out the edges. I've been in the industry for over 30 years. My expertise is around. Strategy, technology, and execution. Sure. I've been around long enough and leading large IT investments and delivering enterprise transformations in the global markets. Just a little bit about Codename37. We help organizations design, build, and run intelligence systems. So that includes everything from AI infrastructure and data platforms to advanced AI solutions, including machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, intelligent agents, and so on. We've also built. One of the most robust Alliance ecosystems in the industry. So that gives our customers secure end-to-end solutions that scale, and we have access to over 12,000 engineers globally. We'll probably just stop right there for now unless you have any questions. Today's meeting is really to just give you an overview of Cloudera and learn a little bit about your environment as well. Jake's going to provide a quick intro of his background and who he is. And if it's okay with you, we'd love to spend just a few minutes getting a better understanding of your current landscape. So we can align the conversation with with the Cloudera overview. So hopefully that's okay. Jake's on what we call a light board. So there are, we don't do PowerPoint presentations. Hope that's okay. We prefer to whiteboard things out. So that's how we'll operate today. Any questions before I hand it over to Jake? I don't think so at the moment. Perfect. But as we go, I might think of something. So. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. Awesome. You have cooler books in the background. Mine are all like. Coloring books and. I don't know what I got. I got a bunch of books. I just keep collecting them. So. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Jake, I'll hand it over to you for a quick intro. Some of them are old college books, mathematics and all kinds of stuff, I guess. Am I seeing Alabama or something in the background or where do we got? Oh, Texas A&M. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. I love it. I got that back there. So. I love it. Richard. It's an honor. It's a. Absolutely. An honor to meet you. I'm Dr. Jake Tripple, co-founder and CTO of Codename 37. Like Mike, been in the industry a long time. I typically have been that executive consultant, principal architect, technical architect, working with countless teams across countless industries worldwide for a long time. If you can't tell by old and gray being in the industry for over 30 years, that's. Okay. It's been an absolute. It's been an absolute ride doing this, working with folks across the world. Go ahead. Sorry. I'm right there with you. I'm almost, I'm getting close to being in industry 40 years. So. There you go. Good for you. I remember when there was no internet, so, you know. Same here. My first computer was a dumb terminal, sadly. There you go. And I know what PowerPoint 1.0 looked like. I remember what Windows 3.1.1, Windows. Oh, Windows 386. So, yeah. I started out with Windows 3.1.1. I started out supporting OS2. Oh, okay. There you go. OS2. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Started with that one too. I still maintain that Windows 2000 Pro is still my favorite OS. Loved it. Never, in terms of even going back in that timeframe in terms of support and like, where I had to spend my time dinking around, I never had a dink around with that OS. That thing was rock solid. But anyway. Yeah. I digress. But no, it's been an absolute blast coming up through all these eras, right? Sounds like. Yeah. We're roughly around the same age. It was fun. The 90s, the rise of the internet. And for me, that was my custom software development era. I'm a 25-year plus Python developer and a former CFO during that time as a former corporate controller for a Fortune 50. And I'm that person who was like, why the hell am I doing all this analysis and review of financial statements? I can automate all of that. And so, anyway, like, why would I sit and flip through all this paper? Who wants to do that kind of stuff? Oh, good. So, I've been developing systems like that for, along with ERP systems and stuff like all that fun stuff for a long time. But anyway, it's been a blast coming up through the eras. Let's see the rise of mobile, the rise of the cloud. Of course now, sorry, all things IoT, if you will, which was also a blast. And you name it, right across cybersecurity. Now, of course, recently as we get into the AI era and all things machine learning and deep learning. That is also the centerpiece of my doctoral work has been all things AI. In my spare time, I'm also a college professor. And I teach at Concordia University, St. Paul here in the Twin Cities. So now you get to tell people you met the lamest person ever. So consult all day, kind of teach all night is kind of who you're talking to. So no, I absolutely love it. I view the two as the same thing. I love helping people and institutions as much as we can and doing what we can to help folks move their jazz along. So that's me in a quick note. That's me in a rapid nutshell. Cool. Cool. Well, please, as you can tell, I've been in it forever for almost 40 years. And I graduated from obviously Texas A&M, computer science, but I just said have the bachelor's and then my minor was electrical. So engineering. Cobol, Fortran, Pascal. I hate it. I stayed. Oh, Pascal, Fortran, C, a little bit of Lisp, a little bit of Ada. Oh, wow. Some of that stuff that's out there. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. I was in the business of that way back when. So punch cards, were you doing punch cards, Richard? I managed to avoid them as much as possible. I don't know if I ever really had to do them, but I was trying to get her back, trying to avoid that stuff and go to the PCs. But yeah, absolutely. My dad did punch card stuff back in the day. I had no idea, Richard, what Ada was until I started working with Lockheed Martin as a consultant. I never heard of it before. I'm like, what is it? And why do you want? And why do you want to move all your, sorry, why you want to start moving essentially all your applications, your script to C++? Like I said, I totally get it because where can you find Ada developers? I actually have a cousin who was an Ada developer who worked for all these defense contractors because I had no idea we were using Ada. That's part of like our Scud missiles. That was the guidance system was all Ada. Yes. So do you have a defense background as well? One of the professors apparently had. Oh, okay. He was working with TI and had some background there. Yeah. And so they introduced Ada and one of the selling points was it was a, was it multi, I forget the, it was multi-threaded. So you can spin off multiple subtasks inside your same program. So yeah, we had to write, I forget, he challenged us to write a project in Ada. And I stayed away, avoided COBOL as much as possible. At the time I was like, I don't want to deal with that. Yeah. But yeah, Ada, Fortran, I always loved Fortran. I thought it was cool. But anyway, you know, that's, I digress. And yeah, I'm familiar, you know, come up, I've got background dealing with AIX, Linux, did, I've done some Perl stuff. I think I, I can, I can hack my way through Python, you know, with the help of AI and stuff. But what you've done all those different languages is like, yeah, just pick one. The new ones seem to be the, I haven't dealt with them. They're like Go and some of that stuff, which they say is pretty cool, but I'm like, okay, whatever. I mean, hey, you come up in basic, you know, right? There's so many different things in basic and visual basic and anyway, and databases. I don't know if you remember, there's a database called Paradox. I don't actually. You remember the company Borland? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and they had, well, you know, they came out with, so it's funny coming up, they had Microsoft had their Pascal version. Borland came out with their Pascal version called Turbo Pascal and it would take us 15 minutes in Microsoft or it'd take us 15 seconds in Turbo. So we were like, okay, we got this. We're good this out. But yeah, no brainer. I think Borland got bought out maybe on Microsoft at some point, but anyway, they had that database Paradox. So it was a relational, I assume a relational database. Okay. It was a relationship. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it was an Edgar Codd or whatever. It was talking about the relational database. Yeah. Stuff and development. I forget. He had his, he had this little saying something about what I can have one, one index, the only index. And so let me cut or something. I forget out with, but one little saying he had about how to do indexes. So there's a long time ago. That was the nineties. My first, uh, the good old days. My first database was D base four. You based for, yeah. So compatible. We can run it with everything. You know, everything wanted to go with D base for format. As long as we can read the files. There we go. So, yep. Very familiar with it. Bring it back. I say, right. Let's start making like, let's just start messing with people, especially the young. Oh yeah. Especially young. And so we talk like this, they look at us like they're in the headlights and you're going, you don't understand the historical reference and the historical things we, you know, these are the building blocks that got us to here. So that's it. And you couldn't have said it better. Um, that's what I also teach. Yeah. It's good knowledge. We just looked at the world a little deeper. Yeah. But that's the, that's, that's what I get from teaching the world is every research they do is like, well, how did I get here? And then I raise that up. Uh, you know, we're in the, in the government or how did you know that theacje earlier when the country was lost quite a bit? Yeah. So my boss is like, leave the programming behind. You're going all network route and switch. And so transitioned completely into the routing and switching and basically Cisco. And as I say, the rest is kind of history on that. Was that before or after TokenRing? We were in the middle of getting rid of TokenRing. Yeah. We were installing Ethernet switches as fast as we could. It was such a big change. Well, we had the 4 gig and the 16 gig TokenRing. Miles, or MAUs. And they're the IBM stuff. And we were like, yeah, well, Ethernet comes along and we're running 10 meg. And then we get the 100 meg. And then, you know, finally 1 gig. But now it's just exploding. Was it 400 gig? We're looking at terabytes. Oh, yeah. That's unbelievable. AI is pushing it. I could have 10 400 gig circuits now. And they're talking. You know, it's just. Just crazy. Now, we're definitely right there at one terabyte. So, just. Yeah, nobody understands that except us. But, anyway. That's it. Yeah, kind of a historical road. We're not here to talk about that. But we can sell you those switches, too. So, just ask. No, AI infrastructure is our thing. Right? And it's like that's where we've been helping a lot of organizations is. To your point, right? AI is changing everything. Your networks are. You know. Don't even get me started on what's going on at the university. Right? Our networks are just bought. You know what I mean? We weren't. We built these architecture and infrastructures for a different time. And it's just like it all. You know, thank God they have folks like you to rethink this stuff. It's like, okay, if this is what it's going to be, we got it. We got to start rethinking absolutely everything to have the bandwidth to do all this crap. And especially like when you have thousands of agents running around one day, which is coming very quickly. Yeah. It's crazy. Between that and the horsepower they have to put in the servers. It's just crazy. Yeah. I. We. Same thing. We sell a lot of compute. We sell a lot of storage. And it's like those are just. They view them as plain Jane, but welcome to this era. You have to. And especially if you're. I assume like you're probably a hybrid environment. You got a lot on prem. You got some in the cloud or something like that. Sound about right. Yeah. Yeah. We're. We're. We're in the midst of that. Yeah. We've got. Uh. We're working. We're working towards our development. Focus mainly on Azure. Sure. Yeah. We've got. We've got. Um. Let's see. If I don't count the virtual. The Azure data center. We've got like four data centers or something like that. Sure. We're trying to consolidate. So. Um. Yeah. We're. And we're. You know. We're building our pathway to Azure. Um. So. And. And. And. The other thing with the clouds. And. Is. Watching our costs. Because. Yeah. Um. The clouds. The cost. Just. Just. Skyrockets fast. If you don't watch it. Yeah. We're seeing quite a few people start coming back on. From. With some things. Right. Doing cloud appropriate. Because we had some. I did a lot of work with Thompson Reuters for a long time. And they went 98%. Into the cloud. Which is unbelievable. Right. Almost unheard of. But the costs have gone through the roof. So. Of course. The board pushed that move. Right. Now the board's saying. Hey. Wait a minute. Why are we spending so much money on the cloud? Right. So. Now you start looking at storage. Right. And storage back on site. Right. And then. Running AI workloads in the cloud is almost. Unbearable. Right. So. AI workloads are coming back on prem. Or colos. Right. But out of the cloud. Right. Yep. Yeah. We're basically looking at. A colo. To help us. You know. Control that cost. Or you said the cost. Between there and Azure. That kind of stuff. So. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. So. Real quick. So. I want to be respectful of your time. But aligned to this conversation. That's why we're here to talk about cloud era with you. So. I totally get. I have a good view. In terms of your environment. I have a million more questions. But we. Don't have time to get into all that fun stuff today. But. Don't know if you guys have gone down the road of the unified data platform yet. So. By chance. You guys already doing Snowflake. Informatica. Databricks. I know we have. Snowflake is coming up. I'm. Kind of outside that realm. Sure. Because I'm. I'm. I'm the network. You know. We're a network. Network team. So. I hear that term thrown around. Or that's. That. Snowflake has been thrown around. Yeah. So. What's happening is. As folks like you. Been. Building out all these architectures. And infrastructures. You guys got SAS applications. You guys have all these platforms. We decided a long time ago. We're going to build a modern enterprise on platforms. Right. Whether they be big SAS applications. Whether it's Azure. Whether it's AWS. Whatever we got going on. Right. And so on. So. That turned into our ERPs. Our. Our CRMs. Everything we got. Right. It turned into Azure. And so on. So. No doubt. You guys are looking at Snowflake. Because you're going to slap that right on top of it. And you're going to try to unify your data somehow. Some way. Because as you know. Because we lived through the same thing too. Because we were probably involved in the building a lot of it. As we were building out all these architectures. And infrastructures. If you will. One thing we never got to. I don't know about you. But. Some companies did it well. But the absolute majority did not. We never knocked down these silos like we intended. We always said we were going to. Then we figured out. Well this is painful. All these integrations. ETL. ELT. And like. Oh. We're going to do these big application integrations engines. And it's like. Who the hell is going to manage all that? This is a pain. I mean. Oh my God. This is painful. And you're like. You got to have translators. You got to. Oh my God. The data. The data is going to be translated. From one database to another. Because we got DB2. We got. Yeah. Informix. You know. Microsoft SQL. All that jazz. You know. You're talking about all that stuff. And then to make one dashboard run report. We're grabbing. We're essentially. How do you want to say? Transforming data through nine different hops. Across different systems. Yes. Then we wondered why. Well why doesn't it work? Well. Someone changed something. I got to go figure it out. Hold on. I'll get back to you. On why field. You know. Field 27 isn't updating anymore. Or why the data is wrong. And so. Anyway. It became this painful thing. That's right. Then came the. The rise of Snowflake. Cloudera. Databricks. And there was others. To resolve this problem. And so. For us. We support them all. But we are. Huge fanboys of Cloudera. And I'll tell you why. Because it aligns to our whole conversation. Real quick. Why? Because. It is the only one product. That works both in the cloud. And on prem. Because most of our customers. Whether you're in the grocery industry. Whether you're in. Energy. Whether you're. Government. Doesn't matter. The industry. We typically see hybrid environments. And where folks are like. Hold on. We're not totally going. All cloud. Because we're doing. These types of workloads. We're going to leave this stuff. We're going to keep. A few data centers. Or whatever. Or if you're like. A. A waste management. Nope. We're going all back on prem. People. We're going six data centers across North America. Because they have big plans for their autonomous fleet. And they're just. It's not. They just. You think of the processing. The model development. That has to happen. You're not doing that in the cloud. It's just unaffordable. If you will. So. But Cloudera is our favorite. Because of. We have infinite flexibility. To work in the cloud. Or on prem. Cloudera goes to where your data is. So if your data is in the data center. We put Cloudera in your data center. Your data is in the cloud. We put it there. If it's in both places. Awesome. We have in both places. Now you're not going to get killed. On the ingress. Egress. If you go down the. And that's why. It's. It's not uncommon. Where you see. Cloudera teamed with Snowflake. For that very reason. This is why Snowflake. Partners with Cloudera. Because they want Cloudera's. On prem capabilities. That they don't have. Databricks. Snowflake. Informatica. You got to send all your data to them. Then across your ecosystem. Now you got to worry about. Ingress and egress. Because you got to take. Massive terabytes of stuff. Move it around. And. We all know. Right. They don't. It doesn't cost you nothing. To get it in there. But. If you're going to take it out. You get. Pooched. It's awful. That's exactly right. Unfortunately. That's why. And plus. We. We touch the space. I still hold. The top secret clearance too. Plus. We know. We're. I love that. We're all having fun. In this AI era. And we're innovating. Like crazy. Cyber security. Is about to come back. To the front of the fold. As really smart people. Start doing really stupid things. And especially. In your world. Yes. Right. They are. Yes. And it's like. Oh yeah. So. The only vendor. That's approved. By the DOD. Oh. Because you have. Control of your whole stack. From A to Z. If you will. Our whole world. Was all built on. Open source technologies. And of course. Then these guys. Take it. Privatize it. Cloud era. Is no different. But that's. Your absolute control. Of ingestion. Orchestration. And store. If you will. You know. The big three. Of this world. It's all in your control. So. Does that make. Does that make sense. So. Yeah. Yeah. It's nice. To hear that. Go ahead. No. It's nice to hear that. Because what you're talking about is. When you talk to the. The cloud providers of the world. You know. We've had conversations. You know. When that data gets out. Gets to their cloud. Who owns it? You know. Exactly. Yeah. Where is it setting? Where is it setting? Yeah. And who's. Regulatory environment. Or country. Country environment. Is it setting in? Yeah. Yeah. Those discussions. And they always. It always. The devil's in the details. When you get into those discussions. So. Yeah. That's where. When we're talking to folks like you. CISOs. And stuff like that. That's where we win all the time. Because it can't. It can't be touched. In terms of your ability for governance. Your ability for data governance. Your absolute controls across those things. And as you're bringing in. Workloads from. I'm sorry. Not workloads. Datasets from. Multiple different systems. Platforms. Whatever. Medallion architectures. Again. All in your governance control. Then. As you really get going. On top of all that. That just makes your journey. To the AI revolution. That much easier. That's. That's why. These companies became a billion dollars. Overnight. And that's what essentially. They're selling. That's what we're talking about. With you. Whether we're talking about. With you. Or if you would recommend us. To talk to somebody else. But. That's the whole of. I know we're running out of time. But that's kind of the whole of. Of Cloudera. And the why behind it. If you. As your organization becomes. This highly automated. Highly intelligent. All things. Data driven. Entity. And as we get into 2026. And I'm sure you're probably. Hearing automation so much. You probably. You know. Throwing up in your mouth. A little bit. And you're going to. But here it comes. Right. Everybody's got a great story. About it. They can. You know. They can tell me. They can. Sell me a story. Yep. But I mean. The whole point though. Without the data. There is no AI. If you don't got your jazz together. You're not going to get anywhere. Really really fast. The bigger problem is. Is like. Now is. Sorry. My. My. My. Markers dying. The bigger challenge is. As all these folks. Come out with their own AI solutions. And now we're going to have. We've been talking about. Data silos for so long. The trap that's coming here. Is AI silos. AI silos. You really want to. I mean. It's like. And it's crazy. But that's also the why. Behind. The unified data platform. Is like. You don't want to go there. I want to bring in the data sets. That are worthwhile to me. Bring it into the unified data platform. Now I can do a lot of. Innovation. And I can start to build out. Agents. And all the cool things. That we're going to want to do. And the things that we're building today. To help folks move forward. Towards their automation. And efficiency goals. Okay. Interesting. Interesting point. Interesting. I didn't. Really know. What. You brought to the table. But yeah. This is. This is very. Very enlightening. And. Yeah. I'll have a discussion. With the other guys. Who are more. In depth. In the middle of this. We. My. Go ahead. I've just got to deliver. The A to Z. Bandwidth. To get there. Yeah. Sure. And we're looking at our. We're looking at our network. Right now. Going. Okay. We got it. What architecture. Do we need to. To go. Switch into. To support this. And if you're. And if it's appropriate. We would love to throw our hat. In the ring. And give you our two cents. Of how we would do that. If we were you. We blend those. We blend those worlds. Together with us. As far as. We view all those things. As a critical part. Of the infrastructure. You got the most. Interesting one. Because boy. Oh boy. Are we going to be moving. A lot. Across your system. And it's only going to grow. To your point. Of like. All the things you mentioned. That. It's not even a hockey stick. It's going to feel like this. It's crazy. Right. More vertical than that. Yeah. It's crazy. Almost straight up. It's crazy. But if you're. If you're ever interested. Or if you want to. Bounce around ideas. In a session. Like this. And so on. Like that. We'd be honored. To have the conversation. To talk about what we would do. If we were sitting in your shoes. And how. What the scale looks like. What's coming. How to anticipate it. Also at the same time. The elements of it. As you select solutions. In here. How to keep it under control. Okay. You know what I mean. Because you can get out of control. Pretty quickly. Right. In this space. When you got lots going on. So. But anyway. Bigger discussion. But we'd be honored. To have it with you. Okay. All right. Yeah. I can keep you. On my list. Of people. When we're talking about this. One thing I don't have. Is I don't know. The road map. To basically. Our server platforms. And where you're going. With those. But we get involved. Some of them. The fact that. Hey. They're. They've got some stuff. That are routing into Azure. Set to stand up in Azure. And all that stuff. But we're just. Beginning to do that kind of stuff. And. You know. We're. You're right. We're in a hybrid. And we're. We're kind of transitioning. Some applications. Run in the cloud. Some applications. Are going to stay on prem. Some applications. We're trying to figure out. Okay. Well. If you're in. Let's say. You're in Google Cloud. Then I need to make a better. Choice. And. Basically. Watch my cost. For how to get there. How to route. Through. Certain pathways. So it's the most. Cheapest. Way to route. And. Most effective way. To get there. Yeah. Work wise. We're learning. New things about how to. How to deal with that too. So. It's. It's. You know. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It never stops changing. So it's always changing. Always learning. Always learning. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. If you get in an IT industry. You gotta be. Okay with change. And you gotta be okay with learning. I can say it that way. You don't have a choice. You're obsolete. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Just think. And. Go ahead. I was gonna say. No. I was gonna say. Richard. Just think. You get to do this twice. Over the next seven years. Just as you figure out. All right. Here's what the AI space is gonna be. Now comes quantum. Where we got. The quantum stuff. I couldn't believe it. I was just giving a speech recently. And Mike and I attended a conference down in New Orleans. Where I attended a executive panel. Was kind of speaking on a lot of these topics too. I couldn't believe. I can't believe how far IBM has come. I couldn't believe it. You know. I was reading up on some of the quantum concepts. And it's like. They presented it like. I don't know. Four or five different concepts. That they're. Kind of work. Trying to work out. In different ways. It works. It's kind of. It's. Interesting. But there. There. Is. Is such an infancy right now. You know. They're still trying to figure out. Oh yeah. The best way. It's. You know. They're competing. They're competing. You know. Google's got its. Like you said. IBM's got its method. And Google's got its method. And I guess. Amazon. You know. Big players are. Going different routes. To see how they get there. So I don't know. You're right. It's gonna be crazy. Wild. Military will be first. Yeah. Military is gonna be first. And then they'll declassify things. And then of course. We'll get the. The stuff that was. Three years ago. But. No. It's. It's coming along. Quickly. Like I thought we had more time. But like I said. Even from what I've seen. Just. Mike and I were just down there. And Mike. When were you down there? December? November. November. I can't believe it. I'm like. You guys are already this far. I mean. I thought like. That's seven to ten here. Horizon. And not. I just think it's gonna. I mean. I personally believe now. Based on what I've seen so far. It's gonna be five. Now. I'm not talking about like. Mass produced or whatever. But then like. Literally. In five to seven years. In my view. We're gonna be like. Really? We gotta plan. Like. Ones and zeros are over. Our programming languages. Are. Are. Our. The current chips. That we have. Are literally gonna be obsolete. Essentially. Overnight. There's gonna be a multi-year transition. To this world. Right. As a. Especially as it matures. Question is. How fast is it gonna mature? I'm just blown away. What I'm seeing already. I did. I had no idea. That they were this far. I couldn't believe it. But anyway. You get to see both cycles. Real quick. It's crazy. Just when we get comfortable. Gotta do it all again. It's crazy. I know. I. Yeah. Yeah. That's. That's a little bit of a mind blowing. Fortunately. Somewhere in there. I might run off into the sunset. I don't know. I was just about to say the same thing. We hear. We hear that. You may or may not see the. Yeah. We hear that quite a bit. And it's like. And honestly. I don't blame people. But here it comes man. It's not slowing down. That is for sure. You know. You know. We have. One thing we've not transitioned. It's out there. But. You know. We have IP. The current state. IPv4. But IPv6. Is a whole different paradigm. Most people. I mean. It's been around. Sure. In a good shape or form. But one of the things that it's got. Is. It's got. A whole different way to. Handle. How it does. You know. Generally. We think of one device. One IP. Or one interface. One IP. But when IPv6 comes along. It's not that. It's one interface. 100,000 IPs. Okay. That completely blows people away. They don't even understand. You get into the multicast. Indicast. And all that. Which may be. A. A perfect fit. For this quantum computing. Where you're talking about. Ones and zeros are going to transition. But you're also going to have. They're going to have multiple. Coming out of. One connection. Multiple different. You know. Ways of communicating. And paths. All at the same time. And also. In the same. Same. Consciousness. And state. Meaning. Yeah. Like. So we're all used to ones and zeros. And linear processing. It's what we've known. And. Rock on. Right. And we have some powerful processors. But nothing like. The idea of. I can be. In 15 different states. At one time. But yet. In the same consciousness. It's kind of like. You having 15 of you. In one consciousness. You're talking to us right now. Another of you is having lunch. Another. One of you is doing other projects. And other. You know what I mean. And think of that level. Right. Productivity. That's what we're talking about here. And like. So to your point. As we talk about like that. Think about what this. And I'm just joking around with 15. We have much higher ambitions than that. And it's like. Now what does that look like? Yeah. And it's like. I can't even. Exactly. Can't even mathematically. Even comprehend. What our architectures. And infrastructures. Start to look like. Yeah. How do you. How do you write. The software. To. To. To do that. And to deal with that. You know. That I'm looking forward to. That is going to be like. Okay. This is going to be like. I got to unlearn everything I've learned. If you will. Yeah. That I'm looking forward to. Like in terms of. Okay. How are we going to do this well? I think that's where AI will be a big help at the time. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. You know. It's probably. It'll probably accelerate AI and its ability. Big time. Yeah. I think so. Big time. How to understand this. Yeah. Yeah. But. Yeah. Bye. Wow. Bye. Bye. All mathematical security as we know it. Because it's irrelevant. When we can process at this capability. And it's going to be all. Now we're going to go all bio. You know what I mean? It's like. Here it comes. Right. And it's. Right. It'll be interesting times man. Wow. You think in seven years we'll see this? Or less? I think. I think it's going to be less. I think so. Based on what I've seen so far. We're going to. As I. You know. Mike and I talk about often. Big reason why. You know. We built the company this way. We're kind of. Call ourselves like that new generation of. Of. Of consulting with a different model. That has to move at the speed of light. The old. We would argue the old traditional consulting model. Is deader than a doornail. Good. Good luck bringing in people. Training them up. Getting them certified. And a bunch of stuff. And you got a five year cycle. To recoup your money. And those other pieces. We went as. Our model is. As Mike kind of described. And begin with. We went as close to the OEM as possible. Because you have to. There's no other path. Right. That's why we're part of the big arrow family of. The big arrow. The global arrow electronics network. And so. That's what we tap into. So. When we bring together teams. You're talking with our. To our compatriots. At Nvidia. HP. Dell. Microsoft. Google. You know. You name it. Right. And so. Combination. The arrow folks. Combination with the OEM. So when we're talking about big enterprise solutions. Like that. It's like. That's what our experiences look like. We're not just saying. We're not just saying. We hope these people know what they're talking about. And they're going to learn on your dime. We just. You can't function that way anymore. It's. We go right to the cutting edge. And. That's how we build our experiences. And our value around that. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. That's. That's interesting. Interesting things to think about. And. And. I think that's happening. And. This is in the. The power generation world. Is. We're on the verge of having fusion. Fusion. Yeah. Nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion. We're right. Yeah. They're actually. Every. Every week. Or almost every day. They're saying. We've got another breakthrough. Yeah. It's crazy. They're. They're running the. They're running the magnetic bottles. And running a hundred. A hundred million degrees Celsius. And they're running. Yeah. And. It's crazy. They told us years ago. We couldn't do that. We're doing. Yeah. It's mind blowing. Yeah. And we need it. Because who's going to power all this stuff. Right. Or what's going to power all this stuff. You've got to have that. You've got to have this power. And this power will be. This will be. This will be a revolutionary power. Because it'll. Generate more power. Than what you put in. Yeah. And that's. That's. That's mathematically. Mind blowing as well. Basically. You brought the sun. Inside. Inside a. A reactor. So to speak. So. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So. That's kind of fun to watch right now too. To see. Where they're going with it. But. And that's where you invest your money. Right. You put it over there. Yeah. It's already happening. You're seeing. What. Two or three different companies right now. One company has told Microsoft. We'll have your fusion. Reactor. In 2027. And you're going. How are you going to do that? I don't know. Yeah. But they. They've. They've licensed with Microsoft. Saying we'll do it. People kind of laugh. But. Trump didn't create the fusion company. For no reason. Based off of his social. If you guys saw that. Right. He's not dumb. He knows where this is going. He knows exactly where it's going. Yeah. And it's. To your point. It's like. We're about to reach. So many big breakthroughs. It's like. This is going to be huge. And it's like. To Mike's point too. We have to have it. Our power grid. Is completely inadequate. For where the hell we're going. Yeah. It's crazy. I don't think nuclear. Is going to get passed. Right. So. Nuclear is the only other option. Right. Yeah. But this. This is. Totally different. Well. The other thing they're doing. With nuclear is. They're coming in and saying. You know. We've got all these ships. That are running. Nuclear reactors. Why don't we just take one of them. And drop them in. Rather than building. The gigantic. Behemoth nuclear reactor. Just build these. Yeah. Small. Miniature nuclear. Reactors. And set them up. Small level. Because. We've been running them. For. What? 50 years. Yeah. Oh yeah. We know how to maintain them. Yeah. And ships. You know. So. And submarines. I mean. You've got a nuclear reactor. And a submarine. Yeah. And it runs. You know. Runs forever. So. They finally woke up. And realized. Well. We do have. Success. Doing this. You know. But anyway. That's. Yeah. That's. And they're. They're changing. Some of their design. On. On the fuel. Or two. So. They've actually made some decent. Inroads. And all of that. And some improvements. Which is. Which is nice. Finally. You know. People are so scared of it. But now finally. People have. Realized. Yeah. They think of bombs. Right. They think of. The general public. And it's like. Yeah. And that's why. As I look at. Investing. Right. As we get older. And we're going to shift it to. It's like. Yes. You know. Is it nuclear? Is it fusion? Is it something else? It's like. It's kind of. You kind of tip your toe in the water. Right. Right. You got AI. You got fusion. You got. You know. Nuclear. You got all these alternative energies. So you're looking at all this stuff to invest in. Yeah. Because it's coming. Finally. Yeah. Which is. That's kind of fun. That's kind of exciting. It is. It is. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun. Fun to think about it. Fun to. And then you've got the. Like you said. The quantum computing too. That's. That's coming as well. Yeah. And our kids and grandkids. Will get it. Yeah. Kids and grandkids. Will be able to play around with this stuff. Right. Exactly. Yes. Oh yeah. My grandkids are. Playing games. You know. Playing stuff now. They're so. They're totally comfortable with all this. Yeah. I need more money. So instead of a. Instead of having a backup diesel generator. For my house. Now I need to have a little mini nuclear reactor back there. To run all this stuff. Exactly. I know. Just. Yeah. Just one portable. Roll one up. And just drop it off. Apparently. Something like that. Why is Jake's house glowing? Yeah. Why am I glowing? All of a sudden. That and the. What else? The other. The other change with the. Oh. The robots. The robots are coming too. Oh yeah. The total automation. You know. They're talking about. Well I was having a conversation with. One of my nephews. And he was talking about. What's the question? Would somebody spend $20,000. For a. Humanoid robot. To do their. Household. Work for them. You know. Done. Taking care of the house. Sold. Yeah. I said. I said. Well advertise that. Over. Yeah. Five years. And then think about. Our 10 years. And does it save you money? Because they can be running. 24-7. You know. Yeah. A hundred percent. Doing the. Doing the. Washing. Doing the cleaning. All that stuff. Just think about that. Get out and mow your yard. We can all just be sitting around. There you go. There you go. And you think about. I'll be fishing. Just. Just think about all of the. The stuff you do. With the elderly generation. And try to help. A hundred percent. And then you've got the other things. Even. Elon Musk. With. Taking and developing. Replacement arms. Yeah. And now he's trying to build. So the blind. You know. Helping the blind to see. Yes. With connecting into the brain. Just all that kind of stuff. And. Just. You know. This is wild. So. Because. And it's. It's coming as fast as everything else. When. Quantum comes out. Quantum. That research for all that stuff. Is going to be lightning speed. Right. Cancel research. All those types of things. Exactly. Yeah. You're talking about possible breakthroughs. All different directions. Oh. Okay. So it is exciting. Especially as we age. Right. Hopefully there's more things out there for us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. You know. The robot will be helping me get around every day. Or I'll be wearing. You know. The exoskeleton legs or something. You know. To help me move. Playing basketball at 90. Yeah. Exactly. Richard. Would it be helpful. If we gave you. If we sent you just a little information. What we usually do after these calls. Is. Is we take our conversation. We make a little web page. That we send over. That has details. Maybe some use cases. Right. But just more information that you can share. Would that be helpful for you? Yeah. It would be. Because I can share it with. One of the other guys too. Talking about this. Okay. Excellent. We'll put that together and send it over. Just so you have some more detail. And no pressure. Right. If you guys see. Any interest in this. I want to further the conversation. We'd love to keep the conversation going. Okay. Sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a fun conversation. Yeah. Yeah. This has been great. Been awesome to meet you, Richard. Hope you had a good holiday. Nice to meet you guys. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your family, man. Well, thank you. Same thing. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. And hopefully have a great year this year. So. Yeah. You as well. Stay warm. I know you guys up there in Minnesota. Stay warm. Looking at whiteness out here. It's the sunshine and it's a little cold in Texas. But, you know. We have. We have had extremes. So it'll bounce to 75 and it'll bounce down to 35. And it'll bounce. It's just. It's tough on the sinuses. But. It's been nice. We were down in Arizona on the 27th through the 3rd. We took the kids and just really let's go. Let's get out of here. Right. And it was like 70s there. It was beautiful. It's like perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Alexa keeps saying it's a beautiful day. Thank you. I mean, it's going to be a perfect day. No snow. No rain. Perfect. It's what you keep saying. I said, okay, whatever. Speaking of. We were in Dallas in November. It was like 80 something. Was that November? That was warm. We opt them. OptumRx. They're down there. And so is Christus Health. So we're doing some stuff with those guys. Right. That's beautiful. This we can get used to. So you're talking about Christus Health. I used to work. Yeah. Okay. Used to work for those guys. Yeah. Yep. Left about a little over four years ago. Okay. Worked with them for about. Well, I worked for another health company, a hospital system, and then Christus bought them. So I was with them for. But Christus bought us. I was there about four years with Christus. So I know a lot of the guys at San Antonio and some of the guys up in Irving as well. Did you go to that new office they built? It's unbelievable. I heard about it. I didn't. I left before they had that office up and running. One of the guys that I joined up with our team, he did actually work in that office and stuff. Yeah. I heard it's great. It's unbelievable. Beautiful facility. Jake and I spent a lot of time in healthcare over the years. We used to do. We were our last company. We were one of Microsoft's top three to help move Epic to Azure. Right. Oh, wow. And I've never seen any healthcare company have money like Christus. We're like, I've never seen a building like this in healthcare. Like this is unbelievable. Right. Over 6 billion a year. And that's a not for profit or nonprofit organization. But they are tied into the Catholic church. So, you know, I think they got a little bit of support there too. But yeah, yeah. They're a huge deal. And you know, they bought the only reason they got into Epic was because of the company, the hospital system I was with, Trinity Mother Frances and Tyler. And they were like, we're going to build a hospital. They're a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge company. Well, they had Epic, right? There was a smaller regional base, but they had spent the money to go to Epic. Well, Christus recognize that if we buy them, we've automatically got into Epic. And then we can turn around and leverage that. Probably cheaper than just rolling it out. And that's exactly what they did. They bought Mother Frances, and then they started transitioning all the rest of their stuff to Epic. And Epic, they had – oh, the other one they had, I forget what the name of it is, but it would only do hospitals. It wouldn't do clinics, but Epic would do both. And Epic's being – I think they're teaching it in med schools too. They are. The new doctors coming in understand it. And so that gave Christus a direct connection into it, and they made the decision somewhere in there when I was there about saying, we're going to deploy Epic everywhere. And it made a lot of sense. I think they did in two years. Wasn't it two years, Jake? Wasn't that what it was? Yeah, I think it was just under three. Three, I think Nalini was saying. Just under three? Yeah. I mean, that's a quick turn. That's a tough turn, right? So they had all the northeast part of Texas was already Epic. So they already knew how to do it. They already had the people in place. All they had to do was scale it up, you know, just scale it up, roll it into San Antonio where their data centers are. Meditech was the other system they had. Oh, yeah. They were pushing Meditech out the door as they rolled Epic out. Sure. Yeah, but they're a huge system. I mean, they're into Chile. They're into Mexico. They're into Columbia. They're into New Mexico, crossing to Louisiana. Yeah. So they had a large network. I mean, when I talk about networks, they're a large-sized network as well. Yeah. And good people. The people we know, did you know Nalini at all when you worked there? The data team? I didn't know him. I knew, I mean, in that time, we transitioned to a new CIO. I can't remember his name. But, yeah. And. Frank? Is it Frank? That's the VP of Finance. Oh, yeah. That's Finance. Yep. But what we, Richard, real quick, what we did there, they're a Cloudera customer. That's what we're, we work with them on that. Oh, really? So we ingest, sorry, what was, sorry, the ERP is Infor. So we ingest Infor and Epic into Cloudera, then all innovations across all the functions go from there. Same idea that I kind of outlined here. But that's what Christos is doing. And smartly, right? Because it's like Epic has tremendous limitations. It's a powerful system. But it's just, there's so many limitations across the system. And this is where we work with them on innovating here. And as we blend these things together and as we build out automations for finance and things of that nature, we're able to move at light speed because of this setup. Wow. Wow. Well, Epic is, Epic was like the Cadillac in the industry going up against the other ERP. What is it? Medical. Yeah. 75% of the market. Still do. But, you know, the other big healthcare systems are all, they were moving to it too. But the interesting thing you brought up is, so Epic is moving, they're setting up in the cloud of Azure cloud. Is that where they're setting their stuff up? So Epic has their own cloud, right? So you can go either Epic cloud or Microsoft put a lot of focus on trying to get that healthcare data, right? And all that stuff. And all their systems. So they were paying people to migrate to Azure and their whole, their whole point was you already have multiple clouds. Do you really want another one and be stuck in the Epic cloud for proprietary use? Right. When you can just bring it here, there's a strong message. But there's still quite a few people that have gone the Epic cloud as well. Right. Right. But Microsoft slowly chewing away at that. That was kind of their, their approach. So they hired a bunch of black Epic. Epic black belt people. And they just, they just went after, right. All these guys. So it was kind of, it was kind of fun. We had a lot of fun working with those folks and doing some of that. We, our last company, we had 150 healthcare organizations. Some was insurance and stuff, but they're all within the health service realm. And it was fun doing those migrations. Interesting. Yeah. Well, so yeah, so I've had a varied background from retail to healthcare to actually, I was, was a company called Suddenlink, which is now Optimum. And we're managing the backbone infrastructure with them at the time. So I was there and then they, I was, they just, Altice came along and bought them out. And, and I left pretty quick after that. Cause it's, I went through two different buyouts. One of them, I bailed out the other one. I managed to survive it with Christos coming in and was there for a while. And then I transitioned back to, to retail with Brookshire. So. What's your favorite out of all the industries? It's hard to pick one. I can give you some kind of some just personal, personal reflection on some of them. When it comes to healthcare, it's amazing how much money healthcare spends. Yeah, it is. It is unbelievable how much money goes through there. I mean, and, and the doctors themselves. The doctors have always been the ones who drive it and say, you know, we've got to buy this. They didn't care what it cost. I want this. And because of their position in health care, pretty much they can get it. So they're kind of wagging the whole rest of the system. You know, they're the tail wagging the dog of everything else. So you're constantly trying to integrate and make that work. So you deal with that in health care. And ISPs are internet companies. It was fun being in the middle of the revenue stream because where you're at is you're sitting here. Everything, your network is what's driving the revenue. So from that perspective, they can pretty much, you can almost justify anything as long as it can bring them money. So you're a profit center. You're not a cost center. Whereas in health care and in retail, you're a cost center. So you have to justify it and make sure the numbers. Retail, it's always, the money is always really close and they're watching you really close. What's your ROI and all that? Because, again, you're a cost center. So all of it is innovation, but the key is how do you present that to management to make sure they understand what they're getting for their money? Yeah. And each industry deals with that differently. So I've learned a lot. I've learned a lot through all different ones. It was fun being in the middle of the internet company, the provider. That was fun from just a network technical side of the house because we were coast to coast. We were from California to, we were in Ashburn, Virginia. We had like five different main pops that we were working with. Very cool. Very cool. Yeah. Doing voice, data, video, all across the country. All across the backbones. Rolling out, you know, million dollar routing boxes, you know, sitting in Chicago, Dallas to pass all that traffic. And that was 10 years, over 10 years ago. When we had 120 10 gigs in just in Dallas. But now, now it's 100 gigs. Now it's 400 gigs. So, you know, it just keeps rolling. So that technology being in the middle of it is pretty wild to watch it grow. So. Yeah. Well, the complexity was probably fun, right? Oh, yeah. That's complex. Yeah. We had both Cisco and Juniper in our networks and we had cross-connected them to get them to work together to do the protocols. There's a predecessor to the current stuff. How we do stuff now was tying data centers together, spanning VLANs, spanning connectivity, spanning servers across, you know. This is all predecessor to that. So now we've advanced further on how we do that. We do that with more, you know, different hardware. But Cisco, Juniper and HPE has made such a huge play into that with buying Juniper. Already had Aruba. Now they bought Juniper. So they're rolling all that together to take on Cisco. And hey, we have a lot of Aruba stuff right now. Our wireless and the SD-WAN technology we're using is both Aruba. We kicked Cisco routers to the curb and went to Aruba's SD-WAN technology. So we kind of flipped different ways. But we're talking, you know, we're looking at Cisco in terms of how we redo our network. Yeah. We at Thomson Reuters, they did, you know, because they Thomson Reuters sold off half their business, right? Refinitiv, that London Stock Exchange bot. So I had all I did all London Stock Exchange business and Thomson Reuters. And they went to a software-defined network, which was super complex. So we did all the migration work right there. Which goes down to moving that 270,000 servers. So you're moving all the server stuff over. You put the software-defined network on there. It's just amazing the amount of work. But they got rid of 40,000 devices in doing that. Yeah. I mean, the complexity. It makes it fun, right? Because it's so complex. And you're so in the middle of it. It's just it's amazing the people that are out there that can do this stuff. I'm on the flip side. I've been in management too long. I can't do any of it. But I can help support it, right? And it's like, man, there's some smart people out there. I'm not one of them. Yeah. I know. Yeah. And that's kind of I have seen it and managed it and moved more into the management world. Yeah. And so I'm like, okay, well, just tell me when to get it done. Who do we need to call to fix it? How much do we need to pay for it? That's, you know. What's it going to cost? How long is it going to take? What's my ROI? Yes. There you go. Because now you got to sell it for management and get them to spend the money on it. So, yep, that's the world I'm in now. But it's fun watching it. Is this what it's going to be like when we retire? We're going to be sitting at coffee shops, chatting it up, the old people talking about the good old days of IT? Of IT, probably. Yeah. When you didn't have to ask permission, you just did it. Yeah. And, you know, ask forgiveness when it broke and they weren't too mad. They got it. They got a little mad, but now you can't even get away with any of that. No. Every time you reboot something, it was an hour, right? So you just sit there and. Yeah. Did that work? Nope. That's changed the site I'm using. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and they didn't, they just, they put up with it. They didn't scream about it. But, you know, nowadays it's different. Yeah. Yeah. The younger generation expects all of this to be available all the time. I don't know if you're like. Yeah, exactly. You know, they expect this and you're like, you know, I'm going to do this. I'm like, you know, what if I do this? It's just, you can't just, you know, there is one thing about it. It is fun to go out in the middle of nowhere and have no connectivity. Yes it is. And I'm like, I don't got no phone calls, I don't got no text, email, nothing, no messaging. Cause they won't work. Yeah. You know? It's the best. Yeah. That's when we first started, right? We didn't have any, I didn't even have a cell phone when I first got in the business, right. No, me either. Yeah. Yeah. um but you get you know you you just enjoy being out there you know yeah you know doing whatever you want to do and you're not worried about you know somebody's trying to get get in touch with you or tell you something whatever then you feel guilty right so then you're on it yeah yeah yeah then you're trying to get on from the middle of nowhere and good luck with that but yeah no that's uh you know I still like doing that too I um my I have my family's uh land and stuff um and so we go out there and we're working on on a house out there my my parents old house so so we're out there in the middle of nowhere and it's literally you you don't have a whole lot of connectivity so that was nice cell phone good luck with the cell phone connection but that's what you tell everybody I'm going here you're not you're probably not going to be a van you're probably not going to be a van you're probably not going to be a van get a hold of me i will say that yeah yeah it's gonna be hit or miss i don't know if uh you know i'll be kind of in or in or out so but yeah it's nice amazing then you get away from all this other stuff yes can actually do stuff yeah i mean how can a robot enjoy what we're talking about yeah yeah exactly it can't you know nope so anyway oh well i don't know what that design personality in it these days but that's a longer story but yeah yeah but is it real or just programmed you know just go are you really you really like me or you just you know told to like me whatever so you know yeah right you think about all the movies you know yeah i mean i think about all the movies you know yeah yeah i think about all the movies you know from will smith's i robot to um terminator was a robot right terminate exactly yeah there we go people get worried about that they can take over and take over all the weapon systems and controls so we hear it all the time about ai right yeah oh yeah they probably come back to you say oh no it's gonna take over yeah some rogue bot is gonna break loose and take over the world take over the world yep but i'm not worried about it i'm not worried about it i'm not either i got jake on my side he'll deprogram it there you go i we're we're headed for this really really really cool future don't get wrong stupid things are going to happen too but we're going to cure especially a lot of the investments that are happening in texas and these massive data centers that are you know we're going to cure disease we're going to help the elderly i mean there's going to be a lot of good things that are going to come from this so hopefully i mean along along with that you know much better quality of life and don't go wrong there's many challenges too but i believe the benefits will far outweigh the liabilities here yeah i know of three large data centers uh under construction right now in texas and apparently they're huge so yep i mean the one that larry ellison sam altman who's all right that's one in appalachia i believe yep and then uh softbank i think is the other major investor but that whole thing they're building that thing to cure i mean they're building that thing to cure disease that's what that that's what the compute's going to really yeah that's cool i mean it's there's a tr head there's in plano plano texas so is it c3 right i think is the is the colo but i had people down in that data center managing all that stuff but yeah they're building one apparently which is just almost due north for little stuff for like tear gas so i i mean there's one in south california i mentioned cellular or miss found a lot of problems with it and going within that twoᅠᅠ Sarasa WS if we touch that area and that's what we did to deal with the senior technician seven days in q uppermost district and uh you know today we're doing other stuff but something you touched on today if one team was to move around inland i think a lot of these伊didkdno't ignite they're going to know about it eventually they'll have all this stuff coming i think we're probably going to get a lot out of that more than just somewhat uh you're on our side here when you come toiron need people especially running the electrical generation and all that stuff you just got to open a little hole in your wall and then no I'm kidding too soon but we live in Minneapolis and you've seen the crap show we're dealing with we're not Minneapolis we're in the suburbs everybody says Minnesota and we're like that's Minneapolis that's not Minnesota don't look us in exactly there you go we're outside Dallas and Houston we're out in Tyler although it's grown but like I said we can get out to the country and ain't nothing around us except hogs deer maybe some coyotes a few things like that a few snakes but you know that's the way it goes and here we all have cabins because we have so many lakes so I got a place that's two hours north and and, there's nothing right you just go up there and it's wilderness and it's awesome there you go it is fish that's cool that is nice yep yep so anyway who else well well it's good to talk to you nice chatting with you good to talk to you Richard nice talking to you yeah nice to meet you guys good to talk to you both you as well we'll send you over some more information and like Jake said if you ever want to run anything by us just like no commitment to work with us but if you're just like hey what do you guys think about this what have you guys seen out there with these companies or I got this idea we love doing that kind of stuff educational stuff so feel free to reach out yeah yeah please do let me send me your contacts and that'd be fun yeah we'll do hey what's going on what you see let me know yeah absolutely oh I'm yeah I'm curious on I was just I just literally was looking at servers not necessarily for for Brookshire's but I was looking at server prices and I saw that well you could buy an AI I think it was a super micro server it's 110,000 oh my goodness but I have heard that they're going for a million and they're that's probably a low end GPU right yeah yeah I'm just like wow wow yeah I've heard that you know coming in a million bucks for a server Dale was saying a million bucks for some of their servers on this kind of stuff yeah whoa so what are they going to charge for for quantum servers oh the bigger part of it is that they're going to charge for quantum servers yeah the bigger problem we're going to have in the short term is now the cost of memory is just going to go through the roof because that's already skyrocketing it's crazy yeah because yeah as I'm developing solutions and as we're developing solutions and ecosystems like that we've always done it from day one but the problem where people get agents wrong is that they make them stateless what I mean why yeah they have to be persistent and it's like so we do that we accomplish that way typically in our solutions we do like a Redis cache yeah along with a vector and a graph system and that's how we can keep you know having the vector be the long term memory the Redis cache being kind of the short term memory if you will where you know you get a much better experience of like oh yeah Richard I know we talked four times and you wanted this this and this you're like what's going on outside of you always having to like here's why I'm calling again here's what's going on you know what I mean it's annoying right so but now everyone's we've been building it for a long time already but now everyone's kind of like figured that out of like stateless sucks in this world we need to remember everything well that's just now memories just shot through the roof of like well now we need this this this and this and it's like yep it's not going to end anytime soon interesting yeah I was I've seen that the price jumped it literally jumped in the last six weeks or two months or something I mean it just starts skyrocketing and they were saying everybody's behind it right now everybody wants it you know and it's not just it's not just flying to man it's not just flying to man it's just high end everything all different you know levels of memory they're buying it like crazy apparently so I didn't know that's what it was but thanks for yeah filling in the filling in the hole there yeah as people like me are designing 50 500 2000 agent systems all of them and I want all of them to remember something that's a lot of it's a yeah that's why we resolved that today however it only it's only going to go so far that's why we're doing it that's why we use a Redis cache or a cache type system have to and we hold then we decide like depending on the use cases we're involved with we decide in our design you know how long we're going to hold it in the cache if you will do we go back 30 days do we go back 90 days it all depends how much yeah are you keeping it all in DRAM so to speak or are you pushing it to flash cache NVRAM that kind of stuff depends on the use case it all it just kind of depends and it's like it's that's where as we walk companies through as we're designing these things out especially as we're designing they all tie together right so we talk you know people just want to talk about the innovation then you got to go back to the infrastructure okay you want all this by the way we don't have it this ain't going to work so that's why we're you're talking to someone who has both conversations of like and it can speak both worlds we're deeply experienced in both worlds to help people out because it's like one can you don't have to talk to each other and guess what you're not going to get anywhere you can design all this cool stuff all you want it ain't going to work or it's going to be really freaking slow and it's it's not good you need a lot more yep so you need a lot more storage as well I guess 100% you do every so you got RAM and storage both of it compute RAM storage GPUs you know what I mean it's like that's yeah it's an infinite scale in terms of like the demand because it's like you saw like yesterday like McKinsey now has 25,000 agents which is somewhat bullshit I know a lot of people there they're basically just doing right now like like cloud code subscriptions across their consultants and things of that nature great awesome they're going to learn how to do build lots of cool things do better analysis buy buy Excel here comes that era but now on what they build they'll run into the exact same problem you have all these people building all these innovations building out all these other pieces it just taxes the existing infrastructure and it's like so now you have 200 people doing all this stuff next you know people are you are coming along being like what the hell are you guys doing what's going on you know what I mean what are we working on here because it's like why am I seeing these massive spikes or just this you know why is our network traffic on a continual trend looking like that it's like because we can innovate at the speed of light now it's crazy yeah wow it's crazy that is pretty wild what took me what once took me 12 to 18 months 10 years ago now it takes me a month maybe wow well I mean it's you know even on a simple level simpler level I can take AI I can take invoices that come in like on a PDF and I say can you just convert that to Excel you know just take the data convert it to Excel rather than me having to try you know the old days of oh let me scan this whatever no let AI just do it for me you know yeah I'll show you how to give me a call I'll show you how to do it without Excel it's even better oh really okay oh yeah alright yeah cool yeah that'd be great because I do deal with a lot of invoices but you know that's part of it okay yeah that'd be cool yeah definitely let me have your context and I do know the CTO talked to him and stuff and you know he's been talking well the CIO and the CTO have been talking a lot about AI and what we're what to expect how we can use it and all that so it'd be interesting we may be talking more to you guys so yeah well one thing there Richard we can offer up like Zoetis I don't know if you know those guys they make medication for animals right they're a pretty big company okay we're doing an education session is it tomorrow Jake or Thursday it's Sunday this week where they got like 30 of their people coming it's not a sales thing Jake and I are not sales people right it's not a sales thing it's here's where this you know state of the state here's what we're seeing from an AI perspective this one's more on platforms right building your own versus buying something out of the box what the differences are that kind of stuff happy to do those things too there's no cost for them we love doing it as you can tell Jake's with his professor background he likes to just you know yeah he knows this stuff so well and and there seems to be a lot of value there right because there's a lot of unknowns uh so that's something that we love to offer up to we love doing it cool well it's fun talking about it you know just it is where we've been and where we're going so and what we're seeing right now I appreciate the update on that on why stuff's getting so expensive so too no end in sight man no end in sight wow wow well we're you know even on our our little server server system so we got in the storage we're we're chewing up storage right now and you know we're trying to explain why but you know it's you gotta spend more money if you don't want to store data you gotta keep you gotta keep you know putting into it so and that's why companies are pulling storage back on prem right if you have a large footprint it's just so expensive up there in the cloud yeah yep yep storage will pay you the cost well I'll pass it on to my my counterpart to give him the good news he's gonna be still spending more money on storage so just get ready that won't happen straight up yeah well good to meet you I appreciate your time guys yeah good to meet you good to meet you too and you as well Richard fun talk and I'll yeah I'll pass on about Cloudera but the other stuff is yeah just being able to get in touch with you guys and talk about what's going on so thank you absolutely yes I liked it it's fun yeah well you have a great day really enjoyed the conversation Richard thanks for your time thank you for your time yeah yeah I enjoyed it too y'all take care have a great day and I hope a great year you too thank you as well take care take care bye bye bye bye
