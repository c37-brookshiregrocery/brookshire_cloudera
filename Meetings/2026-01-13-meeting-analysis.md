# Meeting Analysis: Codename 37 & Brookshire Grocery
**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Facilitated by:** Cloudera Inside Sales Team

---

## Executive Overview

This was an introductory/discovery meeting between Codename 37 (a Cloudera strategic partner) and Richard Gray from Brookshire Grocery's network team. The meeting was originally scheduled via Microsoft Teams but pivoted to Zoom due to technical issues. The conversation was collegial and exploratory—more educational than transactional.

## Primary Themes & Topics

### 1. Unified Data Platform Strategy
**Relevance: HIGH**

- Brookshire is exploring unified data platforms with **Snowflake "coming up"** in discussions
- Richard is outside the direct data platform decision-making but influential on infrastructure
- Codename 37 positioned **Cloudera** as differentiated by:
  - Hybrid deployment capability (on-prem AND cloud)
  - "Goes to where your data is" philosophy
  - DOD approval for governance/security
  - Can run alongside Snowflake (Snowflake partners with Cloudera for on-prem capabilities)

### 2. Hybrid Cloud Architecture & Azure Migration
**Relevance: HIGH**

- Brookshire operates **~4 data centers** plus Azure presence
- Development focus transitioning **"mainly to Azure"**
- Consolidation efforts underway
- Some applications staying on-prem, some moving to cloud
- Building "pathway to Azure" while remaining hybrid

### 3. Cloud Cost Management Crisis
**Relevance: CRITICAL**

Key concerns raised:
- Cloud costs "skyrocket fast if you don't watch it"
- AI workloads in cloud described as **"almost unbearable/unaffordable"**
- Exploring **colocation (colo)** options to control costs
- Ingress/egress fees are problematic ("you get pooched" on extraction)
- Reference to Thompson Reuters going 98% cloud, now facing board scrutiny over costs

**Industry trend noted:** Organizations pulling workloads back on-prem for cost reasons.

### 4. Data Governance & Security Concerns
**Relevance: HIGH**

Richard explicitly raised concerns:
- "When that data gets out... who owns it?"
- "Where is it sitting?"
- "Whose regulatory/country environment is it sitting in?"

Cloudera positioned as strong on:
- Full stack control "from A to Z"
- DOD approval
- Data residency compliance
- Governance controls across ingestion, orchestration, storage

### 5. Network Architecture for AI Era
**Relevance: HIGH for Richard's role**

Current state:
- Already have 10x 400G circuits
- Moving toward terabit requirements
- Traffic growth described as "not even a hockey stick... almost straight up"

Key questions Brookshire is evaluating:
- "What architecture do we need to switch into to support this?"
- How to route to cloud providers (Azure, potentially Google Cloud) most cost-effectively
- Bandwidth planning for AI/agent proliferation

### 6. AI Silos Warning
**Relevance: STRATEGIC**

Dr. Trippel introduced the concept of **"AI silos"** as an emerging risk:
- Beyond data silos, organizations risk creating disconnected AI solutions
- Every vendor/tool building separate AI stacks
- Unified data platform positioned as foundational to prevent this fragmentation

### 7. Future Technology Discussion
**Relevance: CONTEXT/RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**

Extended discussion on:
- **Quantum computing:** Estimated 5-7 years to maturity (revised down from 7-10 years)
- **Fusion energy:** Potentially 2027 for first commercial reactor (Microsoft contract mentioned)
- **Small modular nuclear reactors:** Alternative power solution
- **IPv6 paradigm shift:** "One interface, 100,000 IPs" mental model change
- **Robotics/automation:** $20K humanoid robots for household work
- **Memory/storage costs:** Skyrocketing due to AI demand

## Brookshire Grocery - Current State Assessment

### Infrastructure
- ~4 data centers (not counting Azure)
- Azure presence (growing)
- Consolidation efforts underway
- Aruba wireless and SD-WAN (replaced Cisco routers)
- Evaluating Cisco for network refresh

### Strategic Direction
- Development focus moving to Azure
- Hybrid model (some apps on-prem, some cloud)
- Exploring colo for cost control
- Snowflake evaluation in progress (Richard outside this decision)

### Pain Points
- Cloud cost escalation
- Need for architecture to support AI growth
- Uncertainty about server/platform roadmap
- Routing optimization to cloud providers

### Decision-Making Context
- Richard is network team, not directly in data platform decisions
- Will socialize Cloudera/C37 information with "the other guys who are more in depth"
- Interested in ongoing network/architecture discussions

---

## Business Relationship Context

### Codename 37 Positioning
- Strategic partner of Cloudera (takes "first calls")
- Access to 12,000+ engineers globally (via Arrow Electronics network)
- Expertise: Architecture, data platforms, AI solutions
- Healthcare experience: Christus Health is a Cloudera customer
- Previous work: Microsoft Epic-to-Azure migrations, Thompson Reuters

### Existing Connection
- Richard previously worked at Christus Health
- Codename 37 currently works with Christus Health on Cloudera implementation
- Common industry background created strong rapport

## Opportunities Identified

### Immediate
1. **Network Architecture Consulting** - Richard expressed interest in getting Codename 37's "two cents" on architecture for AI-era bandwidth

### Medium-term
2. **Cloudera Evaluation** - If Richard successfully connects C37 with data platform decision-makers
3. **Hybrid Cloud Strategy** - Consulting on cost-optimized cloud/colo/on-prem placement

### Long-term
4. **AI Infrastructure** - As Brookshire scales AI initiatives
5. **Data Governance Framework** - Given security/compliance concerns raised

---

## Relationship Assessment

**Rapport:** Strong - extensive shared technical history and industry experience created natural connection

**Engagement Level:** High - Richard stayed well past scheduled time, showed genuine interest

**Next Step Likelihood:** Moderate-High - Richard committed to sharing information internally and keeping C37 "on his list"

**Decision Authority:** Low (for data platforms) / High (for network architecture decisions)

---

## Recommendations for Follow-up

1. **Prioritize network architecture conversation** - This is Richard's domain and where he has direct influence
2. **Request introduction to data platform stakeholders** - Snowflake evaluation is active
3. **Leverage Christus Health connection** - Richard knows people there, could serve as reference
4. **Prepare cost analysis** - Cloud cost concerns are critical; provide TCO comparison
5. **Educational session offer** - Similar to Zoetis session mentioned; could include broader Brookshire team
